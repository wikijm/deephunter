##############

The netview (Network View) module shows the list of destination IP addresses along with their popularity (how many other machines in your environment connected to the IP address) that a particular host connected to, from a hostname or a storylineID. For public IP addresses, whois information and IP reputation (based on VirusTotal) is available. Public IP addresses appear as links that point to VirusTotal.
