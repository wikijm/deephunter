Tools: VirusTotal Hash Checker
##############################

Description
***********
The VirusTotal (VT) Hash Checker is taking a list of file hashes (MD5, SHA1, SHA256), submits them to the VirusTotal database, and outputs results in a table with links to VT, a "found" flag that indicates whether each hash is known by VT, the number of malicious detections and the number of suspicious detections.
